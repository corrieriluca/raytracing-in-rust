# Ray Tracing in Rust

Simple path tracer made in Rust based on Peter Shirley's book
[_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

To-do:
- [x] _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ (actually in more than one weekend...)
- [x] Refactor the code
- [ ] Command line arguments
- [x] Progress bar
- [ ] Parallelism (multithreading)
- [x] Save to a better image format (BMP)

## Usage

```shell
$ cargo run --release
```

The resulting image is in `./image.bmp`.
